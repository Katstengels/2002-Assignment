# 2002-Assignment
A group project created by students in NTU to fulfil their SC2002 assessment.

In this project, we created a Hospital Management System (HMS) that can be used to manage appointments, store medical records, manage prescription and medicine inventory, and conduct administrative matters.

We are totally thriving! (please help we are struggling ;-;)
